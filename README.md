# 3D-Engine
creating 3d scene and rendering engine using openGL and C++

# To do
- ~~import multiple objects~~
- ~~object selection~~ and different control mode // control camera half finished
- reset button (for object transformation and scene) // nope
- save scene(?) // not finished in time
- ~~load textures~~ // works with models with only one texture (need to do uv mapping for that e.g. shelf)
- ~~create living room scene (design in blender???)~~
- ~~setup lightning~~ // lamp emit orange light and tv emit blue light
- ~~animation (loop object transformation)~~ // clock hand rotate + toggle room 360 spin
- ~~camera movement // doesn't seem too hard but wouldn't be impactful if the environment hasn't developed~~
    // circular motion looking at the center

# Done
- Basic object control
