# 3D-Engine
creating 3d scene and rendering engine using openGL and C++

# To do
- import multiple objects
- object selection and different control mode
- reset button (for object transformation and scene)
- save scene(?)
- load textures
- create living room scene (design in blender???)
- setup lightning
- animation (loop object transformation)
- camera movement // doesn't seem too hard but wouldn't be impactful if the environment hasn't developed

# Done
- Basic object control
